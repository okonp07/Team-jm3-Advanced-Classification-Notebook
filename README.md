# Team-JM3-Advanced-Classification-Base-Notebook

## Project Overview
Industrialization is the enabler of modern economic growth and development. However, this comes at the cost of emitting greenhouse gases that contribute, negatively, to climate change and ultimately global warming. Governments, eco-conscious organizations, and civil societies around the world are constantly exploring ways to reduce their carbon footprints. Despite many indices pointing towards climate change, many are of the belief that the phenomenon is a hoax. In this project, we are going to use the novel tweets of some individuals to build a Machine Learning (ML) model to identify their beliefs in climate change. The outcome of this model will help companies to predict how their eco-friendly products will be received by their prospective customers.

## Project Aim
To build an ML model that uses the novel tweets of individuals to determine climate change believers amongst them for strategic business decisions. 

## Data details (Source, description and definition)
### Data source
The collection of this data was funded by a Canada Foundation for Innovation JELF Grant to Chris Bauch, University of Waterloo. The dataset aggregates tweets pertaining to climate change collected between Apr 27, 2015 and Feb 21, 2018. In total, 43943 tweets were collected. Each tweet is labelled as one of the following classes:

### Class Description
* 2 News: the tweet links to factual news about climate change
* 1 Pro: the tweet supports the belief of man-made climate change
* 0 Neutral: the tweet neither supports nor refutes the belief of man-made climate change
* -1 Anti: the tweet does not believe in man-made climate change

### Variable definitions
* sentiment: Sentiment of tweet
* message: Tweet body
* tweetid: Twitter unique id

### Jupyter Note book File (Project Base file)
The jupyter notebook in this repository is a detailed documentation of the technical steps taken to complete the defined task in this project. The notebook in this repository is the Base jupyter notebook, on which we shall rely to generate and update submissions of our models performance on Kaggle.

This file will be worked on and improved upon by all team members with the aim of reaching the goals and accomplishing the tasks set out as the goals of the project outlined. By Assessing the contributions of all team members, we shall hopefully generate a final model whchwhichbetter at gauging the sentiments of twitTwitterrs in relation to the subject of climate change. This information will form the bases for decisions to be made by these companies to achieve their coopcooperativels. 

### How to work on the base file as a Collaborator
All teammates have been added as collaborators in the project, and the steps for active participation in the project are detailed below:

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a branch using your name
3. Do the neccnecessaryts in your work
4. Commit the changes to `your branch`
5. Push your modified branch back to GitHub still on `your branch`
6. Discuss merging `your branch` branch with `main` with the team during team meetings
7. Merge your branch with the main branch

### Dependencies
Note that the dependencies required for the notebook to run must be installed in any machine before the jupyter file runs as it should. Note that some of theses dependencies may not install with a simple pip command as you might expect. You may use google, stack overflow and other online resources to install and update the dependencies whenever you need to. These dependencies usually are requisite for the execution of the jupyter notebook.

### Resources
It will help to rely heavily on the materials provided by Explore Data Sciecnce Academy at their learning platform, Athena for instructions on how to create and modify categorical models. please use those resources and kindly update this readme file with relevant links to meterial that may be beneficial to our work
