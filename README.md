# Team-jm3-Advanced-Classification-Base-Notebook
## Project Overview
Climate change is a global problem. Everywhere, governments, companies and other concerned groups are constantly exploring ways to reduce carbon footprints by reducing emmisions of carbon per person as much as possible. The main sources of energy used in the world today are carbon fuels and this reality creates a dilema in our world. The worlds socio-economic system rely heavily on energy and while every body wants to be responsible and leave as low a carbon foot print as possible, the reality remains that energy makes the world go round and in the real world, there is a direct correlation between Industrilization/developmemnt and energy consumption. 

## Team members 
Below is a list of all the members of this team who are to participate in this project. At the time of generating this repository, they are all students at EXPLORE DS academy.
- Prince Okon
- Marvic Cocouvi

## Project Goal
With this context, EDSA is challenging you during the Classification Sprint to take up the task of creating a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data. The goal is to use this information to determine how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. This would add to their market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received. Providing an accurate and robust solution to this task gives companies access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies.

## Data details (Source, description and definition)
### Data source
The collection of this data was funded by a Canada Foundation for Innovation JELF Grant to Chris Bauch, University of Waterloo. The dataset aggregates tweets pertaining to climate change collected between Apr 27, 2015 and Feb 21, 2018. In total, 43943 tweets were collected. Each tweet is labelled as one of the following classes:

### Class Description
* 2 News: the tweet links to factual news about climate change
* 1 Pro: the tweet supports the belief of man-made climate change
* 0 Neutral: the tweet neither supports nor refutes the belief of man-made climate change
* -1 Anti: the tweet does not believe in man-made climate change

### Variable definitions
* sentiment: Sentiment of tweet
* message: Tweet body
* tweetid: Twitter unique id

### Jupyter Note book File (Project Base file)
The jupyter notebook in this repository is a detailed documentation of the technical steps taken to complete the defined task in this project. The notebook in this repository is the Base jupyter notebook, on which we shall rely to generate and update submissions of our models performance on Kaggle.

This file will be worked on and improved upon by all team members with the aim of reaching the goals and accomplishing the tasks set out as the goals of the project outlined. By Assessing the contributions of all team members, we shall hopefully generate a final model whchwhichbetter at gauging the sentiments of twitTwitterrs in relation to the subject of climate change. This information will form the bases for decisions to be made by these companies to achieve their coopcooperativels. 

### How to work on the base file as a Collaborator
All teammates have been added as collaborators in the project, and the steps for active participation in the project are detailed below:

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a branch using your name
3. Do the neccnecessaryts in your work
4. Commit the changes to `your branch`
5. Push your modified branch back to GitHub still on `your branch`
6. Discuss merging `your branch` branch with `main` with the team during team meetings
7. Merge your branch with the main branch

### Dependencies
Note that the dependencies required for the notebook to run must be installed in any machine before the jupyter file runs as it should. Note that some of theses dependencies may not install with a simple pip command as you might expect. You may use google, stack overflow and other online resources to install and update the dependencies whenever you need to. These dependencies usually are requisite for the execution of the jupyter notebook.

### Resources
It will help to rely heavily on the materials provided by Explore Data Sciecnce Academy at their learning platform, Athena for instructions on how to create and modify categorical models. please use those resources and kindly update this readme file with relevant links to meterial that may be beneficial to our work
